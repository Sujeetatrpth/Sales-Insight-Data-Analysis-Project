# Sales-Insight-Data-Analysis-Project

## Objective
To get the sales insight that are not visible before for the sales department of a computer hardware company to support them in decision making and automate it in order to reduce manual time involved in data gathering.

## Problem Statement
This project is based on the case study of a computer hardware business which is facing challenges in dynamically changing market. Sales director of the company decides to invest in data analysis project and wants to get a power BI dashboard that can give him real time sales insights in order to know the actual causes for not generating the expected output by the company. So, it is required to analyze the sales data of the company from each and every aspect and make it visible for ease of decision making by getting answers of some questions like which market, in which year, which customer, what type of product,how much sales quantity, revenue and profit etc.

## Process
So in order to collect all these infomation some tools were used for analyzing all the data. Used MySQL database and analyzed it, performed ETL and data cleaning operations in Power Query Editor, performed data modelling, used DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) and built Power BI dashboard in Microsoft Power BI Desktop to get real time sales insight showing most possible and important aspects for the sales director of the company.

Here is the process flow:

SELECT transactions.*, date.* FROM transactions INNER JOIN date ON transactions.order_date=date.date where date.year=2020;

## To show total revenue in year 2020:

2. Removed -1 & 0 from sales_amount column in sales transactions table 

## DAX functions used

1. To create Base Measure Profit Margin ðŸ‘‰  Profit Margin % = DIVIDE([Total Profit Margin],[Revenue],0)

4. To create Base Measure Revenue ðŸ‘‰  Revenue = SUM('sales transactions'[Norm_sales_amount])
